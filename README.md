# Workshops

This folder contains data science projects developed during workshops with the startup Blent.ai. 


In the first workshop I developped a project on a dataset containing features of different startup and the Cleaned Amount for each of them. 
The features run over different kind: the sector, the city, the period of the year, Investors Name etc. The Amount for each starpup is related with different strentgh to all the features. The model is address the problem of extracting the more important features in order to know the amount for each startup 


In the second workshop I studied the user churn in a bank and their features. The purpose was to encode a model extracting the features and reasons why users leave the bank.
